# Residence-of-light-and-music
Residence of Light and Music is an interactive and amusing installation representing a fusion between music and light. The installation is designed as a selection of musical instruments that can be played in an entertaining manner. The installation is specific due to its focus on developing skills and capabilities hidden in each and every one of us. The visitor creates his/her own combination of tones while experimentation with musical instruments activates sound and lighting effects. 
This entertaining installation consists of three light music benches containing pre-selectable sounds of various instruments. Benches are made of fibreglass with built-in speakers and LED lights. A simple tap on the bench surface activates sound and light. The combination of light and music responds to orders received by visitorâ€™s tap on the bench surface, which are then transmitted via the microcontroller. This installation enables the visitors to create their own combination of melody and light while the Bluetooth connection enables them to also play their favourite song.
